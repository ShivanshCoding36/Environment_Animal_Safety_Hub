# Overharvesting of Medicinal Plants and Ecosystem Imbalance

## Issue #1607 - Educational Feature Implementation

### Overview
This educational feature explores the ecological consequences of overharvesting medicinal plants, demonstrating how excessive extraction disrupts entire ecosystems. Through interactive simulations and visualizations, users learn about the interconnected relationships between medicinal plants, pollinators, soil microorganisms, and wildlife populations.

### Educational Objectives
- Understand the cascading effects of medicinal plant overharvesting on ecosystem balance
- Learn about plant-pollinator relationships and their vulnerability to harvesting pressure
- Explore soil health degradation and its impact on plant regeneration
- Examine wildlife population dynamics affected by habitat disruption
- Develop awareness of sustainable harvesting practices and conservation strategies

### Key Learning Concepts

#### 1. Plant-Pollinator Networks
